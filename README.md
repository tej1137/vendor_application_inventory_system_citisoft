Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Vendor Application Inventory System developed for Citisoft, a consulting firm for global asset managers. The software addresses the inefficiency of scattered information by centralizing data on vendors, software products, and their capabilities into a single, searchable repository.

Developed using the Agile Software Development Cycle, this Windows Forms application allows employees to aggregate, analyze, and manage vendor data effectively, ensuring that strategic planning and client recommendations are based on up-to-date and accessible information.

Key Features
Role-Based Access Control: Secure login and registration with distinct permissions for Admins, Database Engineers, and Database Analysts.

Vendor & Product Management: Complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to manage vendor profiles, product details, and capabilities.

Advanced Search & Filtering: Filter database entries by category, product type, or vendor to quickly identify suitable technology solutions.

Document Integration:

Directly open vendor websites from the application.

View product documentation (PDFs) within the software.

Generate downloadable PDF reports for client presentations.

Review & Rating System:

Rate and comment on products/vendors to share quality insights across the team.

Admin tools to schedule and track vendor review dates.

Language: C#

Framework: .NET / Windows Forms (WinForms)

IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio

Database Design: Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD/EERD)

Methodology: Agile Development, UML Modeling (Use Case, Class, Sequence Diagrams)

Version Control: Git & GitHub

System Architecture & Design
The project follows a structured software engineering approach:

Database Design: A robust relational database schema designed using Extended Entity Relationship Diagrams (EERD) to handle complex relationships between Companies, Products, Locations, and Users.

UI/UX Design: User interfaces were prototyped using Wireframes to ensure usability before implementation.

UML Modeling: comprehensive documentation including Use Case Diagrams for functional requirements and Sequence Diagrams to map out user interactions (e.g., login flows, report generation).
User Roles
Database Analyst: Browses data, searches for solutions, views PDFs, and rates products.

Database Engineer: Maintains the integrity of the data (Add/Edit/Delete vendors and products).

Administrator: Manages user accounts, access rights, and sets review schedules for vendors.
